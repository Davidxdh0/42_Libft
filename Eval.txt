you still need to check for malloc fails and check for multiple operations in one line. 

Too bad about the norm error, and a few mistakes. But you're doing well, and you'll get there!

Todo: 
Itoa anders maken zonder ft_strjoin
- ft_itoa doesnt allocate enough memory in str
    -   memleak if ft_strjoin returns NULL
ft_split - free 2d arraz when malloc fails
-   ft_strchr - use size_t and remove ft_strlen
strstr?
